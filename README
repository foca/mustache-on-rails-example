Example of Mustache inside rails

WORKING:
* loads Mustache::Rails subclasses from app/views/{controller}/{action}.rb
* loads Mustache templates from app/templates/{controller}/{action}.html.mustache
* helpers and routing work

TODO:
* partials
* layouts
* complex helpers (forms!)
* different mime types (not just html.mustache)

See http://github.com/defunkt/mustache/issues#issue/3 for the discussion about this.
